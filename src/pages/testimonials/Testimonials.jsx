          <p>Needed an app to blast incoming project alerts out to my contractors in real time. 
            Michael created it in less than 24 hours and showed me how to use the app easily on both my desktop and phone. 
            Also was there to offer support or minor modications any time they were requested. 
            Additionally, he performed data analysis on our customer base to reveal our top ROI in respect to ads and customer types.
